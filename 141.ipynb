    "* Grouping the data and analyzing the groups - using Pandas aggregate methods.\n",
    "* Work with features - handle missing data if needed, use pandas date APIs.\n",
    "* Manipulate datasets - use joins in needed.\n",
    "* Visualize the data - you can use line, scatter, histogram plots, density plots, regplots, etc.\n",

    "#### Statistical hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Use at least one statistical significance test.\n",
